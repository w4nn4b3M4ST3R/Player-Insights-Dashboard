# 🧠 MID LANE METRICS — Radar Chart Analysis of Top Pro Players

This project analyzes and visualizes the in-game performance of five top-tier professional mid laners using radar charts. The goal is to highlight statistical strengths across multiple gameplay metrics — and showcase why **Chovy** stands out as the best in the world.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes the following mid laners:
- Chovy
- Faker
- Knight
- Zeka
- Shanks

Each player is evaluated across 12 key metrics:
- K/D/A  
- CS per Minute  
- Solo Kills  
- Damage Per Minute  
- Gold Per Minute  
- Kill Participation  
- Gold %  
- CS Differential @ 15 mins  
- Gold Differential @ 15 mins  
- First Blood Participation  
- K+A Per Minute  
- Pentakills  

Datas base on: **Games of Legends** [text](https://gol.gg/esports/home/)

## 📈 Visualization
We use **radar charts** (also called spider charts) to represent each player’s performance. All metrics are normalized:
- The **highest performer** in each metric gets a score of **1.0**
- Other players receive a **percentage score** relative to the best
- Negative values are normalized near zero to maintain a clean, balanced circle

Each radar chart is color-coded per player:
| Player | Color  |
|--------|--------|
| Chovy  | 🟡 Yellow |
| Faker  | 🔴 Red |
| Knight | ⚪ White |
| Zeka   | 🟠 Orange |
| Shanks | ⚫ Black |
